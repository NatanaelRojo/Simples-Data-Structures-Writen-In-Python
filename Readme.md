# Simple Linear Data structures Writen In Python

This repo contains a simple implementation of several linear data structures or collections such as:
* Static Arrays
* Singly Linked Lists
* Double Linked Lists
* Stacks
* Queues

Each collection has the basics operations and simple iterators.
Possible future improvements:
* Higher-order functions for linear structures
* Implementations of a basic tree structure
* Implementations of a basic graph structure

Note: This repo has a didactic objetive. You can suggest changes to improve it!
